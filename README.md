# Private Contacts #

_Private Contacts_ is an Android app to manage your contacts with additional features for **privacy** and **data protection** not offered by your phone's default contacts app.

When any app (e.g. a messenger like WhatsApp) asks for permission to access your phone's contacts, the choice is purely binary: You either give it access to **all** your contacts or none of them. In that moment you will likely feel fine about sharing the phone-numbers of your friends who also have the same app installed, anyway. However, what about the phone number of your doctor, your therapist, etc.? Do you really want to provide that information to everyone asking? Often, the mere presence of that contact on your phone is enough to deduce a lot about your health, preferences and behavior.

## What the app can do right now
Right now, the app simply offers you the typical functionalities of a contacts app without sharing its contacts with any other app. If an app has the permission to access the phone's contacts, it will **not** get those stored in _Private Contacts_ anyway.

## What the app will be able to do in the future
The goal is to connect the app to the standard Android database for contacts. That done, the user will be able to chose for each contact whether it should be shared with other apps or whether it should remain confidential.
